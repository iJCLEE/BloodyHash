./> "BloodyHash" is my creation, a hash generator. 

- Q: Why is it called BloodyHash?
- A: Because a file is akin to a blood sample: it either matches or does not match. 
- Therefore, I designed this tool as both an art piece and a hash generator.

./> NOTE: "BloodyHash.exe" requires "blood.ico" as a key to run. 
> Please ensure that "blood.ico" is located in the same folder as "BloodyHash.exe".

3./> If your file size is large, just wait until it reaches 100%. 
NOTE: If you click on another app or screen and it appears to be stuck, dont worry because it's saving your computer resources, and the file will load eventually.
